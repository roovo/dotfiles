iTerm (mac): ------------------------------------------------------
When you start an interactive shell (log in, open terminal or iTerm in OS X,
or create a new tab in iTerm) the following files are read and run, in this order:
    profile
    bashrc
    .bash_profile
    .bashrc (only because this file is run (sourced) in .bash_profile)

When an interactive shell, that is not a login shell, is started
(when you run "bash" from inside a shell, or when you start a shell in
xwindows [xterm/gnome-terminal/etc] ) the following files are read and executed,
in this order:
    bashrc
    .bashrc

From RVM: ----------------------------------------------------------
There are sites that describe this how it was 10 years ago like here or here so
read to see how it works in current world:

  o When you login graphically to your system it will read ~/.profile so you put there
    settings like LANG which are important for graphical applications.
  o When you open a terminal (except Gnome-terminal & Screen) you open a login shell
    which sources ~/.bash_profile
  o When you execute commands in non login shell like ssh server command or scp file
    server:~ or sudo(without -i) or su (without -l) it will execute ~/.bashrc

~/.bashrc is meant for non login invocations, you should not print there any output -
it makes tools like scp to fail.  It is good idea to put environment variables in
~/.bashrc, things that you depend upon in your scripts (for ssh server script) then
if your system does not source ~/.bashrc by default via /etc/profile you should
source it in ~/.bash_profile file so any login shell will have access also to the same
environment like non login sessions.

RVM by default adds itself currently to ~/.bash_profile file, and the recommended way
is to enable login shell in gnome-terminal (and screen).


From bash man page (ubuntu): ----------------------------------------
When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with
the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile,
if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile,
~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the
first one that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the
shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and
executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.  This may
be inhibited by using the --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force bash to
read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.
